# My Neocities Website

I used Nuxt to create this website, which is hosted on [Neocities](https://rojikaru.neocities.org/).

I will update occasionally (whenever I feel like it) and poke around with SSG and Vue (because I'm a React fella and a total Vue noob), so stay tuned!

## Development

To run the development server, use:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

or any other server-side JavaScript package manager of your choice.
